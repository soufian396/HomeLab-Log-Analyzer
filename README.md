# HomeLab Log Analyzer — Zero-Noise, AI-Powered Daily Summaries  
A fully-local, fully-automated system that turns your chaotic Docker logs into clean, structured, actionable data... every night... powered by your own local LLM.

No cloud.  
No API fees.  
No bullshit.  
Just *pure self-hosted magic*

---

## 🚀 What This Project Does
This tool automatically:

- Collects logs from all (or selected) Docker containers  
- Removes noise, health-checks, pings, spam, repeat lines  
- Feeds the cleaned logs into **your local LLM** via LM Studio  
- Generates a structured **JSON summary** of critical issues, warnings, successes, anomalies, and recommendations  
- Sends you a **daily email report** via N8N  
- Runs 100% offline, on your own hardware

Think of it as your homelab’s private Network God.

##  Why Local LLM?
Because it’s:

- **Free** (no API bills)  
- **Fast** (sub-second inference on small models)  
- **Private** (no logs leaving your machine)  
- **Customizable** (your prompt, your workflow)

Models supported:  
- Qwen  
- Phi-3  
- Llama  
- Anything LM Studio can serve
